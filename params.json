The Add-On allows you to manage your personal custom locations by using a map where you can simply work with. No more annoying [latitude/longitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) parsing with external tools to provide custom locations; DonkeyGuard Location Picker will do this for you.\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\nFirst of all: The application is an Add-On only. You need to install DonkeyGuard first to be able to use it.\r\n\r\n1. Download the application from PlayStore\r\n2. Install it\r\n3. Pick and administrate your personal custom locations\r\n\r\n## Translation\r\nIf you want to translate the application, please visit [GetLocalization](http://www.getlocalization.com/DonkeyGuard_Location_Picker/).

You can start it by tapping the \"Pick\" button from the Custom-Input-Dialog in DonkeyGuard.
